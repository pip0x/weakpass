The tool generates a wordlist based on a set of words entered by the user.
For example, during penetration testing, you need to gain access to some service, device, account, or Wi-Fi network that is password protected. For example, let it be the _Wi-Fi_ network of **EvilCorp**. Sometimes, a password is a combination of _device/network/organization_ name with some date, special character, etc. Therefore, it is simpler and easier to test some combinations before launching more complex and time-consuming checks. For example, cracking a _Wi-Fi_ password with a wordlist can take several hours and can fail, even if you choose a [great wordlist](https://weakpass.com/wordlist/1950) because there was no such password in it like **Evilcorp2019**. 

Therefore, using the generated wordlist, it is possible to organize a targeted and effective online password check.
